# cXc.world Press Kit
Use these images for reporting, communicating, or other purposes, without implying endorsement. 

It IS okay to use these images for commercial purposes, even as far as reprinting and selling shirts, as long as there isn't a stated or implied relationship as an official source of gear, and if you can, please link [our shop](https://www.redbubble.com/people/CurrentXChange/shop?asc=u) or our [linktr.ee/cxc.world](https://linktr.ee/cxc.world) or cXc.world. 

# When representing cXc graphically

For reporting purposes, please don't modify the logo, add elements, alter colors, change proportions, or add filter effects. 

# Memes + Fan Art 

If you want to make Fan Art or Memes, you will have less restrictions, but also inherit a responsibility to communicate your relationship to cXc. If you are a [cXc Tribe](https://lu.ma/cxc) member, you do have an association with cXc. Otherwise don't imply a non-existent association or endorsement, such as opening a shop claiming to be cXc selling products with these images. If you wish to engage in promotional activity that is clearly coming from you, that's wonderful. We put up these images to enable just that. 

Have fun making memes, and don't forget to share them in the [cXc Discord Community](https://discord.gg/u3kpj7xEWZ)
